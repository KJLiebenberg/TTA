    "* Most BAFTA winning actors are from America, followed by England.\n",
    "* Only actors from America and England have won 4 or more BAFTAs.\n",
    "* BAFTA nominations translate to wins very roughly 50% of the time with some notable exclusions:\n",
    "    * Albert Finney and Laurence Olivier both had a win rate that was lower than most\n",
    "    * Its mostly Americans who get nominated but then fail to win. Ever. Poor Robert de Niro!\n",
    "    * Daniel Day-Lewis and Peter Finch (both English) are BAFTA favourites, converting nominations to wins at a higher rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a personal note: I found this exercise quite tricky when trying to use a data set that differed significantly from the example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some queries:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How do I get the tooltip to show more than one name at data point when there are a number of points at the same place?\n",
    "* How do you select for specific rows of data - eg at first I wanted to use a data set of life expectancy by country for a 20 year span. So how could I select a specific country (ie row) and show the data as x-axis year and y-axis life expectancy?\n"
